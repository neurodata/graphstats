\usage{
gs.sbm.fit(g, community.attribute, edge.attr = NULL, vertex.label = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{an \code{igraph} object. See \code{\link[igraph]{graph}} for details.}

\item{edge.attr}{the names of the attribute to use for weights. Should be in `names(get.edge.attribute(graph))`. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which assumes the graph is binary.
\itemize{
\item{\code{is.null(edge.attr)} constructs sbm on the graph as a binary adjacency matrix.}
\item{\code{is.character(edge.attr)} constructs sbm of the graph the graph as a weighted adjacency matrix, with edge-weights for \code{E(g)} given by \code{E(g)[[edge.attr]]}.}
}}

\item{vertex.label}{an attribute for naming the vertices. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
\itemize{
\item{\code{vertex.label==FALSE} name the vertices \code{V(g)} sequentially, as 1, 2, ... n.}
\item{\code{vertex.label==TRUE} name the vertices \code{V(g)} as \code{V(g)$name}.}
}}
}
\value{
the probability matrix for each block, as an \code{igraph} object.
Vertices will be the unique communities for attribute \code{community.attribute}. Each vertex in the resulting graph will have an attribute \code{community} indicating the vertices in \code{graph} that
comprise the particular community the vertex summarizes See \code{\link[igraph]{graph}} for details.
