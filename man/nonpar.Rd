\title{Nonparametric two-sample testing using kernel-based test statistic}
\usage{
nonpar(G1, G2, dim, sigma = NULL, alpha = 0.05, bootstrap_sample = 200,
  plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{G1}{an igraph object}

\item{G2}{an igraph object}

\item{dim}{dimension of the latent position that graphs are embeded into}
}
\value{
\code{T} A scalar value \eqn{T} such that \eqn{T} is near 0 if the rows of
\eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} are from the same distribution and \eqn{T} far from 0 if the rows of
\eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} are from different distribution.
}
\description{
This is a simple implementation of the kernel-based test statistic for the nonparametric
two-sample testing problem of given \eqn{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n} i.i.d. \eqn{F} and
\eqn{Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_m} i.i.d. \eqn{G}, test the null hypothesis of \eqn{F = G} against
the alternative hypothesis of \eqn{F \not = G}. The test statistic is based on embedding
\eqn{F} and \eqn{G} into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then compute a distance between
the resulting embeddings. For this primitive, the Hilbert space is associated with the
Gaussian kernel.
