\title{Generates a random matrix to use as a
 starting point of the multistart (SGM-step) algorithm. For some
 \eqn{alpha} in (0,\code{g}), output matrix is weighted towards the bary-center
 by \eqn{(1-alpha)} and towards another randomly generated
 doubly-stochastic matrix by \eqn{alpha}.}
\usage{
rsp(n, g)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the dimension to make the output matrix}

\item{g}{(short for gamma) a number between 0 and 1 input
by the user as an upper bound for step \eqn{alpha}}
}
\value{
a random doubly stochastic matrix
}
